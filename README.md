# Classification-of-Myocardial-Infarction-

Business Problem- 
Myocardial Infarction(Commonly known as “Heart attack”)  is one of the most challenging problems of modern medicine. Acute myocardial infarction is associated with high mortality in the first year after it. The incidence of MI remains high in all countries. This is especially true for the urban population of highly developed countries, which are exposed to chronic stress factors, irregular and not always balanced nutrition.

Objective-
To classify the Lethal outcome (cause) by using the given dataset for taking necessary precautions to avoid acute myocardial infarction which is associated with high mortality.

Project Architechture-

Understanding the business requirement and dataset.
Loading the dataset and checking the missing values.
Descriptive statistics and missing values imputation(numerical and categorical).
Normalizing the continuous variables.

Feature engineering for selecting optimum number of features.

Splitting data into test train sets.
Dataset balancing for train dataset.
Building model.
Check accuracy for train data using the model. 
Check accuracy for test data using the model.
Check accuracy for test data using the model.
Model selection on accuracy.
Flask based deployment of model.
Making Html Templates for input and output.
Finally deployment of model on Heroku.
